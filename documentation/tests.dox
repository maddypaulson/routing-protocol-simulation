/** @defgroup Tests
 *
 * The test suite was designed were designed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the implementations for both the Distance Vector (DVR) and Link State (LSR) routing protocols.
 * \section unit_test  Unit Tests
 * The suite includes unit tests for individual functions and integration tests that 
 * simulate real-world networking conditions. Tests includes tie breaking situations, adding routers and applying changes on network.
 * For the Distance Vector Routing 
 * include verifying the update of routing tables upon receiving new distance information 
 * and ensuring that routers correctly decide whether to accept or ignore incoming 
 * messages based on their current knowledge of the network topology. Similarly, tests 
 * for the Link State Routing protocol assess the distribution of Link State Packets 
 * (LSPs) throughout the network, confirming that all routers attain a global view of 
 * the network topology and correctly compute shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
 * \subsection unit_test_usages Usage
 * To run the test suite, execute the following command from the root directory of the project:
    * \code
    * python3 test/test_dvr.py
    * python3 test/test_lsr.py
    * \endcode
 * \section script_test_lsr LSR Script Tests - AI Generated
    * The test suite includes a python class TestLSRCustomDijkstra that simulates in a simpler way the LSR protocol (With no need to share information between routers).
    *
    * We aslo include a bash script that runs both our implementation and the custom implementation and compares the results.
    * 
    * The script is located in the test folder and can be run with the following command:
    * \code
    * bash test/test_lsr.sh
    * \endcode
    * 
    * The script will output if both scripts generated are equal.
    * 
    * \b Disclaimer: The custom implementation was generated by an AI and in tie breaking situations it does not perform following the requirement of the project.
    *  Due to time constraint we decided not to further improve this test suite.
