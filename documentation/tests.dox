/** @defgroup Tests
 *
 * The test suite was designed were designed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the implementations for both the Distance Vector (DVR) and Link State (LSR) routing protocols.
 * The test utilizes an adapted version of Dijkstra's algorithm to compare the output
 * with the results from running `lsr.py` and `dvr.py`. 
 *
 * The suite includes unit tests for individual functions and integration tests that 
 * simulate real-world networking conditions. Tests for the Distance Vector Routing 
 * include verifying the update of routing tables upon receiving new distance information 
 * and ensuring that routers correctly decide whether to accept or ignore incoming 
 * messages based on their current knowledge of the network topology. Similarly, tests 
 * for the Link State Routing protocol assess the distribution of Link State Packets 
 * (LSPs) throughout the network, confirming that all routers attain a global view of 
 * the network topology and correctly compute shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
