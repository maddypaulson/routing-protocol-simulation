/** @defgroup Super Parent Classes
 *
 * \subsection network Network
 * 
 * The Network class serves as the foundation for simulating routing protocols within 
 * a network of routers. It acts as a parent class for more specific network types, 
 * such as DistanceVectorNetwork and LinkStateNetwork, which implement the Distance 
 * Vector and Link State routing protocols. This class is designed to manage
 * a collection of router instances, each represented by the Router class, and facilitates
 * the initialization and manipulation of the network topology based on input from a 
 * topology file.
 *
 * Key functionalities of the Network class include the ability to add and remove links 
 * between routers, update routing tables, and simulate the sending of messages across 
 * the network. It achieves this through methods that add routers to the network, 
 * establish links with specified costs between these routers, and update the network 
 * topology in response to changes. Additionally, the class supports message routing, 
 * where messages are sent from a source router to a destination router.
 *
 * \subsection router Router
 *
 * The Router class is crucial in the simulation of routing protocols within a 
 * network, serving as the base class for specific router implementations, such as 
 * DistanceVectorRouter and LinkStateRouter. This class encapsulates the fundamental 
 * attributes and functionalities required by a router in a networked environment, 
 * including maintaining a list of neighboring routers, managing a routing table, 
 * and facilitating the update and retrieval of routing information. More descriptions about
 * the properties and functions of routers are available in Router.py.
