\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Chat\+GPT 4\+: This tool was used on multiple different occasions to help figuring out/correcting Python syntax and assisted the creation of bash scripts.
\item Git\+Hub Copilot\+: This tool was used in order to create comments for doxygen documentation. Human review was performed for these comments, and adjustment mades on a need-\/basis.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The tool performed extremelly well, saving a lot of time on the tedious process of documenting code.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Generative AI was {\bfseries{NOT}} used for the classes implementation and algorithms logic
