\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Test file for Link\+State\+Routing. 

This script includes unit tests for the Link State Routing (LSR) simulation, specifically testing the distribution of Link State Packets (LSPs) across a network and verifying correct network topology knowledge among routers. Tests cover scenarios with both fully connected and disconnected graphs, ensuring the Link\+State\+Network and Link\+State\+Router classes accurately implement LSR functionalities. Essential for validating the integrity and correctness of LSR implementations in simulated network environments. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
