\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the Network Class, that is the parent of the Distance\+Vector\+Network and Link\+State\+Network classes. 

This file defines the Network class, which serves as a foundatio for simulating various routing protocols, including both Distance Vector and Link State routing. The Network class is responsible for maintaining a collection of Router objects, initializing the network topology from a specified topology file, and providing core functionalities such as adding or removing links between routers, updating routing tables, and handling message transmissions across the network. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
