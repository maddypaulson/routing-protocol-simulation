\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the Router Class, that is the parent of the Distance\+Vector\+Router and Link\+State\+Router classes. 

The Router class provides foundational attributes and methods for simulating routers in a network, supporting both Distance Vector and Link State routing protocols. It includes functionalities for neighbor management, routing table maintenance, and basic routing information updates. This class is intended to be extended by subclasses implementing specific routing logic, serving as a core component in the simulation of network routing dynamics. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
