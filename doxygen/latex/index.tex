\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Chat\+GPT}} 4\+: This tool was used on multiple different occasions to help figuring out/correcting Python syntax and assisted the creation of bash scripts.
\item {\bfseries{Git\+Hub}} {\bfseries{Copilot\+:}} This tool was used in order to create comments for Doxygen documentation. Human review was performed for these comments, and adjustments made on a need-\/basis.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The tool performed extremely well, saving a lot of time on the tedious process of documenting code.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Generative AI was {\bfseries{NOT}} used for the classes\textquotesingle{} implementation and algorithms\textquotesingle{} logic.
