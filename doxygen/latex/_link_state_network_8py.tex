\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the Link\+State\+Network Class. 

This module defines the Link\+State\+Network class, which extends the Network base class to simulate the operation of a network using the Link State routing protocol. It manages the creation and interaction of Link\+State\+Router objects to represent individual routers within the network. Key functionalities include the initialization of the network topology from a given file, distribution of Link State Packets (LSPs) to build a complete network topology view at each router, application of Dijkstra\textquotesingle{}s algorithm for routing table calculations, and handling of dynamic network changes and message forwarding. This class demonstrates the core principles of Link State routing, including global topology awareness and shortest-\/path routing, through the generation, distribution, and processing of LSPs. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
