\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}


The test suite was designed were designed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the implementations for both the Distance Vector (DVR) and Link State (LSR) routing protocols. \hypertarget{group___tests_unit_test}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Unit Tests}{Unit Tests}}\label{group___tests_unit_test}
The suite includes unit tests for individual functions and integration tests that simulate real-\/world networking conditions. Tests includes tie breaking situations, adding routers and applying changes on network. For the Distance Vector Routing include verifying the update of routing tables upon receiving new distance information and ensuring that routers correctly decide whether to accept or ignore incoming messages based on their current knowledge of the network topology. Similarly, tests for the Link State Routing protocol assess the distribution of Link State Packets (LSPs) throughout the network, confirming that all routers attain a global view of the network topology and correctly compute shortest paths using Dijkstra\textquotesingle{}s algorithm. \hypertarget{group___tests_unit_test_usages}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{group___tests_unit_test_usages}
To run the test suite, execute the following command from the root directory of the project\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3\ test/test\_dvr.py}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3\ test/test\_lsr.py}

\end{DoxyCode}
 \hypertarget{group___tests_script_test_lsr}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{LSR Script Tests -\/ AI Generated}{LSR Script Tests -\/ AI Generated}}\label{group___tests_script_test_lsr}
The test suite includes a python class Test\+LSRCustom\+Dijkstra that simulates in a simpler way the LSR protocol (With no need to share information between routers).

We aslo include a bash script that runs both our implementation and the custom implementation and compares the results.

The script is located in the test folder and can be run with the following command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{bash\ test/test\_lsr.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}


The script will output if both scripts generated are equal.

{\bfseries{Disclaimer\+:}} The custom implementation was generated by an AI and in tie breaking situations it does not perform following the requirement of the project. Due to time constraint we decided not to further improve this test suite.
