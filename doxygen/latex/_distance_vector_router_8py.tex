\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the Distance\+Vector\+Router Class. 

This file defines the Distance\+Vector\+Router class, which extends the Router base class to implement router functionalities specific to the Distance Vector routing protocol. Key responsibilities include deciding whether to transmit or accept routing information based on the protocol\textquotesingle{}s rules, enabling the iterative process of distance vector routing. The class plays a crucial role in the simulation of Distance Vector networks by facilitating the update and updating of routing tables among neighboring routers, adhering to the principles of distance vector routing for path determination and message forwarding.
